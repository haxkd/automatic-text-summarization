# automatic-text-summarization
Text summarization is a critical natural language processing (NLP) task that involves condensing lengthy documents or articles into shorter, coherent summaries while preserving the most important information. In this project, we will explore several text summarization techniques, including KL-Sum, LexRank, LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis), LEXRANK, and TF-IDF, implemented using Python, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), SUMY, and integrated into a Django web application.

KL-Sum:
KL-Sum, short for Kullback-Leibler Divergence Summarization, is a probabilistic model-based approach for text summarization. It calculates the importance of sentences based on their likelihood of appearing in the summary and selects sentences that maximize the summary's informativeness.

LexRank:
LexRank is a graph-based summarization technique that treats sentences as nodes in a graph, where edges represent the similarity between sentences. By applying PageRank-like algorithms, LexRank identifies the most central sentences in the graph, which are likely to be included in the summary.

LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis):
LSA is a technique that analyzes the relationships between words and sentences in a document using singular value decomposition (SVD). It identifies latent semantic structures and extracts sentences that capture the underlying meaning of the text, resulting in a more coherent summary.

LEXRANK:
LEXRANK is a variation of LexRank that incorporates cosine similarity to measure the similarity between sentences. It is particularly effective in identifying sentences that are both important and non-redundant, leading to concise and informative summaries.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):
TF-IDF is a classic technique in text summarization. It calculates the importance of words in a document based on their frequency and rarity across the entire corpus. Sentences are then ranked based on the TF-IDF scores of their constituent words, and the top-ranked sentences form the summary.

Language and Tools:

Python: Python is a widely-used programming language for natural language processing and web development.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): NLTK is a powerful library for NLP tasks, providing tools for tokenization, stemming, and more.
SUMY: SUMY is a Python library specifically designed for text summarization. It offers various summarization algorithms, including the ones mentioned above.
Django: Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables the development of web applications with ease and efficiency.
In this project, we will leverage the capabilities of Python, NLTK, SUMY, and Django to build a web application that takes input text, applies these summarization techniques, and presents the user with concise and meaningful summaries. Users can choose their preferred summarization method and interact with the summarized content through a user-friendly web interface. This project aims to showcase the versatility of Python and its libraries in handling complex NLP tasks like text summarization while providing a practical and user-centric solution.
